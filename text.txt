Sentiment Analysis – Determine the emotional tone of text (positive, negative, neutral)

DATA SET
Sourced from subreddits concerned with mental health based conversations
Targets given have the following mappings:
0 = Stress
1 = Depression
2 = Bipolar disorder
3 = Personality disorder
4 = Anxiety

Columns:

text → The full Reddit post content.

Very detailed, often multiple paragraphs, includes personal feelings, experiences, and sometimes rules or guidance (like the check-in post).

This will be the main input for NLP tasks.

title → The post’s title.

Usually a short summary of the post or a key emotional statement.

Could be used for additional features in your models or just for context.

target → Label column.

1 indicates the post is related to mental health / depression (at least in this sample).

Could be used for supervised classification (predict if a post indicates mental health concerns).
